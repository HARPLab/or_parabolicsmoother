## An OpenRAVE Plugin for Parabolic Smoothing ##

This is an OpenRAVE wrapper to a fast smoothing algorithm for robot manipulator
trajectories under geometric constraints and bounded acceleration.

It is based on code provided with the paper:
  * K. Hauser and V. Ng-Thow-Hing, *Fast Smoothing of Manipulator Trajectories using Optimal Bounded-Acceleration Shortcuts by*, ICRA 2010.
